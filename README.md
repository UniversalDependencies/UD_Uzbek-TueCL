# Summary

The Uzbek-TueCL treebank is part of a parallel Universal Dependencies corpus containing 148 sentences across four Turkic languages: Turkish, Azerbaijani, Kyrgyz, and Uzbek.


# Introduction

Uzbek-TueCL consists of 148 carefully selected sentences (940 tokens) compiled from multiple sources, including the Cairo corpus (20 sentences), the UDTW23 corpus (20 sentences), and 97 additional examples illustrating specific grammatical constructions of interest. Tokenization was carried out automatically. Lemmatization, POS tags, morphological features and dependency relations were annotated manually.


# Acknowledgments
